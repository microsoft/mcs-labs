# Simplified Lab Configuration - Auto-Discovery Based
# Only contains journey definitions and optional section customizations
# Labs are automatically discovered from folders and README files
#
# IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION NOTES:
# =================================
# 
# JOURNEY SYSTEM:
# - The 'journeys' section defines journey cards displayed on the homepage
# - Only journeys listed here will appear as cards on the main page
# - Bootcamp is intentionally EXCLUDED from this section to prevent homepage display
#
# BOOTCAMP CONFIGURATION:
# - Bootcamp has a dedicated page at /labs/bootcamp/ with special numbering (1a, 1b, 2, 3a, etc.)
# - bootcamp_lab_orders section defines lab sequence for bootcamp page
# - Bootcamp navigation link is hardcoded in _layouts/default.html header
# - labs/?bootcamp=true parameter still works for dynamic filtering
#
# LAB ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM:
# - lab_journeys section assigns individual labs to their respective journeys
# - Labs can be assigned to multiple journeys for cross-journey visibility
# - Bootcamp labs are NOT assigned here to prevent homepage appearance
#
# NAVIGATION ARCHITECTURE:
# - Homepage: Shows journey cards (excludes bootcamp)
# - Top Navigation: Home | All Labs | Bootcamp (hardcoded links)
# - Bootcamp Page: Uses bootcamp_lab_orders for custom sequencing
# - All Labs Page: Shows all labs regardless of journey assignment

# =====================================================
# AUTO-DISCOVERY RULES (Optional - for documentation)
# =====================================================
# The system automatically:
# 1. Scans labs/ folders for README.md files
# 2. Extracts metadata from lab details tables
# 3. Auto-assigns sections based on:
#    - Difficulty levels (100=core, 200=intermediate, 300+=advanced)
#    - Folder name patterns (autonomous=advanced, 30-mins=optional, etc.)
# 4. Auto-assigns journeys based on:
#    - Difficulty and content analysis
#    - Keywords in titles and descriptions
# 5. Uses intelligent defaults for missing metadata

# To override auto-assignment, add YAML front matter to lab README files:
