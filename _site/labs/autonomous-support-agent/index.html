Think of a traditional help desk: Without autonomous agents: Support staff manually reads every email, searches knowledge bases, checks ticket systems, and crafts individual responses - consuming hours of valuable time With autonomous agents: AI automatically processes incoming emails, searches your knowledge base, retrieves ticket information, and sends comprehensive responses in seconds Common challenges solved by this lab: “Our support team spends too much time on routine email inquiries” “Users have to wait hours for simple password reset instructions” “We can’t scale our support to handle increasing ticket volumes” “Checking ticket statuses across systems is time-consuming and error-prone” In just 20 minutes, you’ll transform how your organization handles support requests, freeing your team to focus on complex issues that truly need human expertise. 🌐 Introduction Customer support automation has become essential for organizations looking to scale their operations while maintaining high service quality. Manual email responses and ticket lookups create bottlenecks that frustrate both support staff and end users. Real-world example: A mid-sized company receives 200+ support emails daily asking about password resets, ticket statuses, and common troubleshooting steps. Without automation, their 3-person support team spends 60% of their time on these routine inquiries, leaving complex issues unaddressed and creating long response times. After implementing autonomous agents, the same company now handles 80% of routine inquiries automatically, with instant responses that include personalized ticket updates and relevant knowledge base articles. The support team can focus on strategic initiatives and complex problem-solving, while user satisfaction increases due to immediate, accurate responses. 🎓 Core Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Autonomous Agents Enable 24/7 automated responses to user inquiries, reducing manual workload and improving response times while maintaining consistency in support quality Triggers Events, as simple as “Email received”, that trigger autonomous agents to then automatically detect and process the content and context initially provided Knowledge Connect agents to your existing documentation and knowledge sources, ensuring responses are accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with your organization’s information ServiceNow Integration Provide real-time ticket status updates and incident details directly within email responses, eliminating the need for manual system lookups Multi-language Support Automatically detect and respond in the user’s preferred language, improving global support accessibility and user experience 📄 Documentation and Additional Training Links Microsoft Copilot Studio Documentation Building Autonomous Agents with Copilot Studio ServiceNow Connector Documentation Office 365 Outlook Connector Copilot Studio Triggers and Actions ✅ Prerequisites Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio with appropriate licensing ServiceNow instance with API access and valid credentials Office 365 environment with Outlook integration enabled Administrative permissions to create and configure autonomous agents A test email account to simulate user interactions 🎯 Summary of Targets In this lab, you’ll build a complete autonomous support agent that transforms how your organization handles routine support inquiries. By the end of the lab, you will: Create and configure an autonomous agent with email triggers for automatic activation Integrate knowledge sources to provide accurate, contextual responses to user questions Connect ServiceNow for real-time ticket status updates and incident details Configure email response tools that reply professionally with proper formatting and citations Test the complete workflow with realistic support scenarios and multi-question emails 🧩 Use Cases Covered Step Use Case Value added Effort 1 Create and Configure an Autonomous Agent Establishes the foundation for automated email processing with intelligent trigger configuration 10 min 2 Add Knowledge and Tools Connects external knowledge sources and ServiceNow integration for comprehensive automated responses 10 min 🛠️ Instructions by Use Case 🧱 Use Case #1: Create and Configure an Autonomous Agent Set up the foundational autonomous agent with email triggers that automatically activates when support emails arrive.

Click Save to finalize the tool configuration Configuring Agent Instructions and AI Settings Navigate to Overview and then click the Edit for Instructions Paste the following comprehensive instructions: ``` Understand and isolate each question from the received email body. For each individual question, do a separate knowledge search using the configured knowledge sources. If a ticket ID is mentioned, for example INC0000059, check if an update is available using the tool. Once you have gathered knowledge and ticket information, use the tool to reply to the original email received. Your reply should use the same language as the initial user email (e.g., if the questions are in French, reply in French, etc.) ``` [!IMPORTANT] For each of the placeholder &lt;…&gt; in the description, use / to insert the tools you just configured in your instructions. [!TIP] Note: the UX may differ and you don’t have that option, leave the description as-is. Click on Save to save the instructions and Publish your agent to activate it Testing Your Complete Agent Send a test email to your training user email by using the Workshop Agent. Simply ask Send a support email. You will then shortly receive the email in Microsoft Outlook. [!IMPORTANT] Access the workshop agent in the same location as when you created your training user account. You will need the workshop code and your training user’s email address if you previously closed the agent. You can repeat this process as desired. The email should contain something like this: Hi! I hope you&#39;re doing well! I had a couple of questions - what are the steps again to reset your Now Support user password? Also, was wondering if you had an update on my cases INC0000059 and INC0000055 Much appreciated. Thanks! Make sure you receive the email in your inbox, in outlook.office.com [!TIP] You don’t need to repeat the original trigger event to make more tests. In the Test pane, you can select ..., choose Test trigger and then select the desired trigger and from there, decide to execute a past trigger again. Check the execution of your autonomous agent by going to the Activity tab. Select the Refresh icon until you see the execution. Check the emails in your Sent folder in Outlook to see the actual reply the user autonomously sent. [!TIP] Agents can be both conversational and autonomous. Meaning that they can be triggered by an email (such as an email received) or by an end-user simply using a chat or voice interface. If the agent is purely autonomous, you can safely delete the default custom topics that are useless to it: Goodbye Greeting Start Over Thank you You can also disable the system topics that it won’t need: Conversation start Conversational boosting End of conversation Escalate Fallback Multiple topics matched 🏅 Congratulations!

</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!TIP]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agents can be both conversational and autonomous. Meaning that they can be triggered by an email (such as an email received) or by an end-user simply using a chat or voice interface.</li>
    <li>If the agent is purely autonomous, you can safely <strong>delete</strong> the default custom topics that are useless to it:
      <ul>
        <li>Goodbye</li>
        <li>Greeting</li>
        <li>Start Over</li>
        <li>Thank you</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You can also <strong>disable</strong> the system topics that it won’t need:
      <ul>
        <li>Conversation start</li>
        <li>Conversational boosting</li>
        <li>End of conversation</li>
        <li>Escalate</li>
        <li>Fallback</li>
        <li>Multiple topics matched</li>
