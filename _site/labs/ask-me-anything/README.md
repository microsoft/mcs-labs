## 🤔 Why This Matters

**Makers and IT professionals** - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems?

Think of your organization's knowledge like a library:
- **Without an intelligent agent**: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available
- **With an intelligent agent**: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "I can't find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site"
- "What's the status of my ServiceNow incident?"
- "Can someone help me structure these meeting notes properly?"
- "I need information from multiple systems but don't know where to look"

**This 40-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge.**

## 🌐 Introduction

In today's fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it's HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently.

**Real-world example:** Imagine Sarah, a new employee in Germany, needs to understand her leave entitlements. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent "Ask me anything" agent, Sarah simply types "What's the leave policy for Germany?" and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration.

This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses.

## 🔄 Use Case #4: Knowledge Prioritization Techniques

Implement context-aware knowledge routing for personalized and relevant responses.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Knowledge Prioritization Techniques | Implements context-aware knowledge routing for personalized and relevant responses | 8 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn different techniques to help prioritize the right knowledge sources based on context.

**Scenario:** The SharePoint site has different folders for different country leave policies. Asking "What's the leave policy?" doesn't return relevant results and seems to randomly pick a leave policy for a country. You need to implement context-aware routing.

### Step-by-step instructions

Let's start by asking for the user country at the beginning of the conversation. In many situations, this can be obtained from context, either passed from a web page to the agent, or by making an initial call (for example to the Entra ID connector) to get more information about the logged-in user and their location.

#### Setting an office location in Entra ID

1. Start by assigning an office location to your user. Use the **Workshop Agent**  and ask `Set location`. You will then be prompted to choose from a list of countries, and then hit **Submit**. This will update your user's Office Location property in Microsoft Entra.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Access the workshop agent in the same location as when you created your training user account.
> - You will need the workshop code and your training user's email address if you previously closed the agent.
> - You can repeat this process as desired.

#### Getting the office location of the logged-in user at the start of the conversation

<!-- replacing with instrucftions on how to do this on message received, so it works in M365 channel too

2. Now, in your 'Ask Me Anything' agent, go to the **Topics** tab, and then to the **System topics** tab.

3. Open the **Conversation Start** topic

4. At the beginning of the topic, right after the **Trigger**, add a new node **(+)** and choose **Add a tool**.

5. Go the **Connector** tab, and search for `Microsoft Entra ID Get user`

6. Select the **Get user** connector action and **Submit**.

  ![alt text](images/add-tool-connector.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you don't see the **Get user** action, select another of the Microsoft Entra ID actions, such as **Create user**  and **Submit**.
> - Then in the topic command bar, select `...` and **Open code editor**.
> - Update `CreateUser` to `GetUser` in both **operationId** and **variable**.
> - Select **Close code editor**.
> - In the **Get user** node, select `...` and **Refresh** 

7. In the **Get user** node, select `...` and **Properties** 

8. Toggle the **End user authentication** to **Agent author authentication**.

9. In the **Inputs** tab, for **User Id or Principal Name**, select `...`, go the the **System** tab, and select **User.Id**.

![alt text](images/select-user-id.png)

10. **Save**

 -->

2. Now, in your 'Ask Me Anything' agent, go to the **Topics** tab, and then to the **System topics** tab.

3. Open the **Conversation Start** topic

4. At the beginning of the topic, right after the **Trigger**, add a new node **(+)** and choose **Add a tool**.

5. Go the **Connector** tab, and search for `Microsoft Entra ID Get user`

6. Select the **Get user** connector action and **Submit**.

  ![alt text](images/add-tool-connector.png)

7. In the **Get user** node, select `...` and **Properties** 

8. Toggle the **End user authentication** to **Maker-provided credentials**.

9. In the **Inputs** tab, for **User Id or Principal Name**, select `...`, go the the **System** tab, and select **User.Id**.

![alt text](images/select-user-id.png)

10. Give your topic a name, such as `Office Location` and **Save**

11. Test if everything is working as expected by **refreshing** the conversation test pane.
   
12. **Send** a message such as:

```
Hello!
```

15. Navigate to the **Topics** tab, open the **Office Location** topic, and to see what values are returned from the connector, enter the **Variables** pane in the topic command bar. Go the **Test** to see the variable values at runtime (i.e., as you are testing in the conversation test pane).
  
  ![alt text](images/variables-pane.png)

16. Select **Value** under the **GetUser** record, and **expand** it to see if the expected value was returned.

![alt text](images/user-record-entra-id.png)

17. Because we will need to use that variable value in other parts and topics of the agent, select the **GetUser** variable and make it **Global**.

![alt text](images/set-global-variable.png)

18. **Save**

#### Dynamically filtering the searched SharePoint site with the office location

19. Go to the **Topics** tab, select **+ Add a topic** and choose **From blank**

17. Update the topic name from **Untitled** to `Leave policy`

18. Under **Describe what this topic does** paste: 

```
Use this tool for questions about leave policy, time off, etc.
```

19. Add a new node: **Advanced > Generative answers**

20. For input,  select `...`, go to the **System** tab and choose the **Activity.Text** variable.

> [!TIP]
> The **Activity.Text** variable is super useful because it captures the last message/text the user has typed in or selected when interacting with the agent.

![alt text](images/activity-text.png)

21. Go to the **properties** of the **Create generative answers** node

22. Select **Search only selected sources** and **don't select anything**

> [!TIP]
> This means that none of the knowledge sources that are configured at the top level of your agent will be used.

23. Toggle off **Allow the AI to use its own general knowledge (preview)**

24. Expand **Classic data**, for **SharePoint** (not Public websites!), toggle **Manual input** to **Formula**

25. Select the `...` and go to the **formula** tab

26. Paste the **SharePoint classic data formula**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Use the formula provided in the **Lab Resources** (specific per training).
> - Notice how the formula concatenates the SharePoint URL with the office location, effectively using context to target the correct source and location for the content.

  ![alt text](images/sharepoint-formulas.png)

27. Select **Insert** once done, then **Save** your topic

28. **Refresh** the test pane and ask:

```
What's the leave policy?
```

29. **Verify** that the leave policy used to generate this answer is the one matching the country you selected.

> [!TIP]
> If formulas are too much code, you could also use condition nodes and configure different branches based on the selected country.

#### Influence knowledge searches with instructions 

30. You can also influence how knowledge searches are performed by updating your agent instructions. Go to the **Overview** tab and go **Edit** the **Instructions**

31. **Paste** the below line

```
Always start by triggering the  topic.
Always append the user country () in knowledge search queries (e.g., "<question> in <country>?") that are HR related.
```

32. We need to designate the topic to trigger in the instructions. **Type** `/` and select **Office Location**.

32. We also need to set the variable value in-between the parenthesis. **Type** `/` and select **Power Fx**.

  ![alt text](images/instructions-formula.png)

33. **Type** `Global.GetUser.officeLocation` and select **Insert**

34. **Save** the instructions

35. **Test**

```
What benefits do employees get?
```

36. Notice how the query is **rewritten** to take into account the **variables** you provided, like country, **augmenting the chances** of returning the correct results for summarization.

## 🔄 Use Case #5: Create a child IT Support Agent

Integrate real-time incident management for comprehensive support capabilities and demonstrate agent scoping techniques.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Add ServiceNow Incidents | Integrates real-time incident management for comprehensive support capabilities with agent scoping best practices | 8 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll configure the connection to ServiceNow to retrieve incident details, and learn how to scope agent capabilities for specific domains. This demonstrates how specialized tools can be integrated to create domain-specific expertise within your agent.

**Scenario:** Employees need quick access to their ServiceNow incident status without navigating to the ServiceNow portal. By integrating ServiceNow directly into your agent, you're creating a specialized IT support capability that showcases agent scoping - where specific tools and knowledge are targeted for particular use cases, improving productivity and reducing support burden.

### Understanding Agent Scoping with ServiceNow Integration

This use case demonstrates **agent scoping** principles:
- **Specialized Tools**: ServiceNow integration provides domain-specific capabilities
- **Contextual Routing**: IT-related queries automatically leverage ServiceNow tools
- **Unified Experience**: Users get comprehensive support from a single agent interface

### Step-by-step instructions

#### Create a child agent

1. Go to your Ask Me Anything agent

2. Go to the **Agents** tab, and **+ Add an agent**

    ![alt text](images/add-agent.png)

3. Update 
    - Its **Name** to: `IT Support Agent`
    - Its **Description** to:
      ```
      Use this agent for queries related to IT (e.g., knowledge base frequently asked questions, incident updates, etc.) 
      The agent can multiple multiple questions and queries at once.
      ```
    - Its **Instructions** to:
      ```
      Use knowledge for problem/how-to/questions.
      Use the Get ServiceNow ticket details tool to get the status of incidents.
      ```

#### Add knowledge to the child agent

4. Select **+ Add** in the **Knowledge** section of the child agent

5. Select **ServiceNow**

6. Choose the **ServiceNow** connection under **Your connections**, and **Next**
   
8. Select **Knowledge** as the knowledge source.

9. Select **Add to agent**

#### Add ServiceNow ticket details as a Tool to the child agent

1. **Save** your child Agent
  
2. Still within the **IT Support Agent**, scroll down to **Tools** and **+ Add a tool**

3. Search for  `ServiceNow List records`

4. Select **Add and configure**
   
5. **Rename** to `Get ServiceNow ticket details`

6. Change **description** to `Gets the details of an incident using its incident number. Use this tool when users ask about ServiceNow tickets, incident status, or IT support requests.`

> [!TIP]
> The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it's important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage.

7. Under **Additional details**, change **Credentials to use** to **Maker-provided credentials**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents.

8. For **Record Type**, under **Fill using**, choose **Custom value** and choose `Incident`

9. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Query**

10. Next to **Dynamically fill with AI**, select **Customize** and use this for **Description**:

    ```
    The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., 'numberCONTAINSINC0007001'. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001)
    ```

> [!TIP]
> - Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries.
> - If you get a "There is an error: 'DuplicateItem'" error, toggle to **Custom value**, then switch back to **Dynamically fill with AI** and set the customized **description** again.

11. Select **+ Add input** and choose **Limit**

12. Under **Fill using**, choose **Custom value** and  set **1**

13. Select **Save**

#### Test your IT Support Agent 

28. **Test** your agent:

    ```
    My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you're here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It's been quite a while since I've opened them... thanks!!
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Notice how the agent automatically:
> - Asks the user to consent before running a search using ServiceNow knowledge. 
> - Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type
> - Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060)
> - Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting
> - Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed

  ![alt text](images/multi-agent-servicenow.png)

29. **Observe** how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities:
    - **Tool Selection**: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent
    - **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools
    - **Domain Expertise**: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps
    - **Unified Experience**: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent.

## 🔄 Use Case #7: AI Summary and Review of Meeting Notes

Automate document analysis with human review workflows for accuracy and approval.

| Use case | Value added | Estimated effort |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| AI Summary and Review of Meeting Notes | Automates document analysis with human review workflows for accuracy and approval | 7 minutes |

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you'll learn how to upload files and run files through a prompt for analysis, and how to use adaptive cards to ask for human review for edits before submitting a meeting report.

**Scenario:** Employees need help structuring meeting notes efficiently while maintaining human oversight for accuracy. You'll implement AI-powered analysis with human review workflows.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. Open your Ask Me Anything agent

2. Go to the **Topics** tab, select **+ Add a topic** and choose **From blank**

3. Name your topic `Meeting Notes`

4. Under **Describe what this topic does** paste: 

```
Use this tool to help users with meeting notes
```

  ```
  Using the content of the uploaded document, populate the following JSON record (for the schema, only string properties, no arrays, except for Data and time) with:
  - Title of the meeting
  - Description/summary
  - Date and time
  - List of attendees
  - Action items / next steps

  {
    "MeetingTitle": "Title of the meeting",
    "MeetingSummary": "Description/summary",
    "MeetingDateTime": "Date and time",
    "MeetingAttendees": "List of attendees",
    "MeetingActions": "Action items / next steps"
  }
  ```

13. **Test** your prompt

14. **Save** your prompt

    ![alt text](images/prompt.png)

14. **Save** the topic.

15. In the **Prompt** node, choose the `File` variable as the input for **UploadedNotes**.

16. **Create** a new variable for the output of the prompt node, and rename it `MeetingAINotes`

17. Add a new node, **Ask with Adaptive Card**

18. Go to **Adaptive Card** node **properties**.

19. Select **Edit adaptive card**.

20. In the **Card payload editor**, paste the below **JSON**:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.5",
        "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "body": [
            {
                "type": "TextBlock",
                "text": "Please review and confirm the meeting minutes",
                "weight": "Bolder",
                "size": "Medium"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "meetingTitle",
                "label": "Meeting title",
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingTitle>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "attendees",
                "label": "Attendees",
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingAttendees>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "date",
                "label": "Date and time",
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingDateTime>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "summary",
                "label": "Meeting summary",
                "isMultiline": true,
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingSummary>"
            },
            {
                "type": "Input.Text",
                "id": "nextSteps",
                "label": "Next steps",
                "isMultiline": true,
                "value": "<Replace with MeetingActions>"
            }
        ],
        "actions": [
            {
                "type": "Action.Submit",
                "title": "Confirm minutes"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

20. Select **Save** and **Close**.

> [!TIP]
> Notice how the Adaptive Card editor offers a visual editor to create your own Adaptive Card experience with a no-code/low-code editor.

21. We now need to make the card dynamic to reference the content that was returned from the prompt. Toggle from **JSON card** to **Formula card**.

22. **Expand** the formula for more screen real estate.

23. For each `"<Replace with ...>"`, **replace** with the matching `Topic.MeetingAINotes.structuredOutput.<property>` variable. 
  
    Don't forget to remove the double quotes.

24. **Save** your topic

25. Add a new **Message** node, and paste:

  ```
  Thank you! I've successfully logged your meeting notes in our systems.
  ```

26. **Test** your agent. Try to modify the content directly in the adaptive card before selecting **Confirm minutes**.

  ```
  Please help me with my meeting notes
  ```
