<meta name="description" content="Create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) Agent This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating an MBR (Monthly Business Review) Agent, which is designed to streamline the preparation process for MBRs. By following the guide, users will learn how to query resources and obtain quick answers, ultimately enhancing efficiency and organization for business reviews. It’s a valuable tool for anyone looking to optimize their workflow and ensure they are well-prepared for important business discussions. 🧭 Lab Details Level Persona Duration Purpose 100 Maker/Developer 20 minutes After completing this lab, participants will be able to create a conversational agent hosted in SharePoint. You’ll learn how to add knowledge sources, test and publish to SharePoint. 📚 Table of Contents Why This Matters Introduction Core Concepts Overview Documentation and Additional Training Links Prerequisites Summary of Targets Use Cases Covered Instructions by Use Case Use Case #1: Create SharePoint site and upload MBR documents Use Case #2: Build and deploy MBR agent Summary of Learnings Conclusions &amp; Recommendations 🤔 Why This Matters Managers and Team Leads – Drowning in slide decks, scattered data, and last-minute scramble sessions before Monthly Business Reviews? Think of a traditional MBR prep process: Without agents: Leaders dig through dozens of decks, copy/paste insights, manually summarize risks and themes, and chase down team updates – all while trying to spot patterns across silos With agents: AI reads files from SharePoint, extracts key themes (like at-risk deals or blockers), and delivers concise summaries you can act on – no digging required Common challenges solved by this lab: “We waste hours each month trying to consolidate MBR decks from every team” “Leadership misses key risks or repetitive asks buried in PowerPoint files” “It’s hard to spot trends across different teams without a data analyst” “We’re reactive instead of proactive when it comes to business risks” In just 20 minutes, you’ll learn how to build an agent that helps leaders get to the ‘so what’ faster—turning static decks into actionable insights. 🌐 Introduction Monthly Business Reviews (MBRs) are critical for keeping leadership informed, identifying risks, and aligning on key initiatives. But the preparation process is often tedious and fragmented, requiring hours of manual effort to gather, review, and summarize insights from multiple teams. Real-world example: A regional sales org prepares for its MBR by collecting slide decks from over 10 team leads. Each deck includes updates, at-risk deals, and escalations—buried across inconsistent formats and file names. A single director spends 4–6 hours manually scanning each one, summarizing recurring themes, and building a master summary for leadership. After implementing an agent, the director simply prompts the system to scan the latest MBR files in SharePoint. Within seconds, the agent highlights common risks, summarizes recurring asks, and surfaces trends across teams. Now the director can focus on strategic insights—not file wrangling. 🎓 Core Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Conversational Agent Powers natural, chat-like interactions so users can ask about MBR themes, risks, and takeaways without needing to dig through files manually Knowledge Enables the agent to read and understand content from past MBR decks stored in SharePoint, so it can extract relevant insights and patterns Testing in Copilot Studio Helps you validate that the agent understands user intent and returns accurate, useful responses before it’s shared with others Publishing to SharePoint Makes the agent accessible to your team directly from a SharePoint site, so anyone preparing for an MBR can use it on demand SharePoint Agent Setup Seamlessly integrates with your existing file storage so your agent always has access to the latest MBR decks—no need to move files around 📄 Documentation and Additional Training Links Microsoft Copilot Studio Documentation Copilot Studio Triggers and Tools ✅ Prerequisites Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio with appropriate licensing Microsoft 365 environment with SharePoint access 🎯 Summary of Targets In this lab, you’ll build a conversational MBR agent that streamlines how managers and leaders access insights across Monthly Business Review decks. By the end of the lab, you will: Create and configure a conversational agent using Copilot Studio Add knowledge sources by linking SharePoint-stored MBR files to the agent Test the agent to ensure it can accurately summarize risks, trends, and key themes Publish the agent to a SharePoint site so it’s easily accessible to stakeholders Enable your team to ask questions like “What are the common risks this month?” and get immediate, actionable answers 🧩 Use Cases Covered Step Use Case Value added Effort 1 Create SharePoint site and upload MBR documents Establish centralized document repository for MBR data that the agent can access 10 min 2 Build and deploy MBR agent Create intelligent agent that analyzes MBR documents and provides instant insights 10 min 🛠️ Instructions by Use Case 📁 Use Case #1: Create SharePoint site and upload MBR documents Set up a dedicated SharePoint site with MBR documents that will serve as the knowledge source for your agent.

<h2 id="-why-this-matters">🤔 Why This Matters</h2>

<p><strong>Managers and Team Leads</strong> – Drowning in slide decks, scattered data, and last-minute scramble sessions before Monthly Business Reviews?</p>

<p>Think of a traditional MBR prep process:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Without agents</strong>: Leaders dig through dozens of decks, copy/paste insights, manually summarize risks and themes, and chase down team updates – all while trying to spot patterns across silos</li>
  <li><strong>With agents</strong>: AI reads files from SharePoint, extracts key themes (like at-risk deals or blockers), and delivers concise summaries you can act on – no digging required</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common challenges solved by this lab:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“We waste hours each month trying to consolidate MBR decks from every team”</li>
  <li>“Leadership misses key risks or repetitive asks buried in PowerPoint files”</li>
  <li>“It’s hard to spot trends across different teams without a data analyst”</li>
  <li>“We’re reactive instead of proactive when it comes to business risks”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In just 20 minutes, you’ll learn how to build an agent that helps leaders get to the ‘so what’ faster—turning static decks into actionable insights.</strong></p>

<h2 id="-introduction">🌐 Introduction</h2>

<p>Monthly Business Reviews (MBRs) are critical for keeping leadership informed, identifying risks, and aligning on key initiatives. But the preparation process is often tedious and fragmented, requiring hours of manual effort to gather, review, and summarize insights from multiple teams.</p>

<p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> A regional sales org prepares for its MBR by collecting slide decks from over 10 team leads. Each deck includes updates, at-risk deals, and escalations—buried across inconsistent formats and file names. A single director spends 4–6 hours manually scanning each one, summarizing recurring themes, and building a master summary for leadership.</p>

<p>After implementing an agent, the director simply prompts the system to scan the latest MBR files in SharePoint. Within seconds, the agent highlights common risks, summarizes recurring asks, and surfaces trends across teams. Now the director can focus on strategic insights—not file wrangling.</p>

  <li><strong>Testing importance</strong> – Always validate agent responses before deployment to ensure accuracy</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment flexibility</strong> – Agents can be deployed directly to SharePoint for seamless user access</li>
  <li><strong>Reference linking</strong> – Well-configured agents provide source citations for transparency and verification</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lessons learned &amp; troubleshooting tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Test with various question types to ensure comprehensive knowledge coverage</li>
  <li>Check that agent responses include proper source citations</li>
  <li>Verify deployment permissions align with your organization’s security requirements</li>
  <li>Remember that agents need time to index new documents after knowledge source updates</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenge: Apply this to your own use case</strong></p>

  <li><strong>Document organization matters</strong> – Well-structured SharePoint libraries enable better agent knowledge extraction and more accurate responses</li>
  <li><strong>Test comprehensively</strong> – Validate agent performance with realistic business questions before deploying to stakeholders</li>
  <li><strong>Leverage source citations</strong> – Agents that provide document references build trust and enable users to dive deeper into source material</li>
  <li><strong>Deploy strategically</strong> – SharePoint deployment puts the agent where users naturally work with documents</li>
  <li><strong>Iterate based on feedback</strong> – Monitor agent usage and refine knowledge sources based on common user questions and needs</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="-conclusions--recommendations">📌 Conclusions &amp; Recommendations</h2>

<p><strong>MBR Agent golden rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep MBR documents in consistent formats and naming conventions for optimal agent understanding</li>
  <li>Test agent responses against known document content to ensure accuracy before deployment</li>
  <li>Use specific, business-relevant questions during testing to validate real-world usefulness</li>
  <li>Deploy agents to locations where users naturally work to maximize adoption</li>
  <li>Regularly update knowledge sources to keep agent responses current and relevant</li>
  <li>Monitor common user questions to identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these principles, you’ll create MBR agents that not only provide accurate information but transform how leadership teams prepare for and conduct business reviews, turning hours of manual document review into minutes of intelligent conversation.</p>
