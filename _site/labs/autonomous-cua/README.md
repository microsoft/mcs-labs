## ü§î Why This Matters

Legacy systems without APIs create major roadblocks for automation. Traditional RPA often relies on fragile screen-scraping or manual workarounds, which slow down decision-making, increase errors, and reduce productivity.

This lab introduces Microsoft Copilot Studio and Computer Using Agents (CUA) as a smarter solution. By simulating human interaction with internal systems, CUAs can securely access and process data - without needing API integration. You‚Äôll learn to build an autonomous agent that delivers faster responses, reduces manual workload, and enables real-time, informed decisions.

## üåê Introduction

In this lab, you‚Äôll learn how to build an autonomous agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio. This agent will simulate human interaction with a legacy internal system to retrieve financial portfolio data without requiring direct API access.

**Real-world example:** A financial advisor needs quick access to key portfolio details - such as client name, portfolio value, and assigned manager - to prepare for meetings, review performance, resolve issues, or recommend rebalancing. However, this data resides in a legacy system that lacks an API and is restricted from direct access.

Traditional RPA tools may fall short in such scenarios. They rely on fragile screen-scraping and require constant maintenance, making them unreliable and costly for dynamic, real-time use cases.

As a result, advisors must depend on back-office teams to retrieve information, causing delays, inefficiencies, and a higher risk of errors - ultimately limiting their ability to make timely, informed decisions.

By implementing a Copilot Studio agent, advisors can securely and instantly retrieve accurate portfolio data. This improves response times, reduces manual workload, and enhances overall productivity without the limitations of traditional RPA.

## üéì Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Autonomous Agents** | Enable 24/7 automated responses to user inquiries, reducing manual workload and improving response times while maintaining consistency in support quality. |
| **Triggers** | Events, as simple as "Email received", that trigger autonomous agents to then automatically detect and process the content and context initially provided. |
| **Tools** | Tools are simple or sophisticated connectors that the Copilot Studio orchestrator can invoke in response to user queries or business events. |
| **Computer use tool** | Enables the agent to interact with any system that has a graphical user interface. It works with websites and desktop apps by selecting buttons, choosing menus, and entering text into fields on the screen. It performs the task on a computer you set up using a virtual mouse and keyboard, enabling agents to complete tasks even when there isn't an API to connect to the system directly. If a person can use an app or website, Computer use can too. |
| **Hosted browser** | The hosted browser runs in a Microsoft-managed environment and lets you get started with Computer use quickly without any machine setup. It provides both web automation using Microsoft Edge and access to built-in Windows applications. |
