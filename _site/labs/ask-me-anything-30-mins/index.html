Participants will deploy agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot, use multi-agent orchestration to query a child agent to connect to ServiceNow to retrieve ticket status. 📚 Table of Contents Why This Matters Why Start with ALM? ALM Introduction Core ALM Concepts Overview Lab Introduction Core Concepts Overview Documentation and Additional Training Links Prerequisites Summary of Targets Use Cases Covered Instructions by Use Case Use Case #1: Create a solution and custom publisher Use Case #2: Create connection references Use Case #3: Create an ‘Ask Me Anything’ Agent with SharePoint Knowledge Use Case #4: Configure Suggested Prompts Use Case #5: Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot Use Case #6: Create a child IT Support Agent 🤔 Why This Matters Makers and IT professionals - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems? Think of your organization’s knowledge like a library: Without an intelligent agent: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available With an intelligent agent: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations Common challenges solved by this lab: “I can’t find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site” “What’s the status of my ServiceNow incident?” “I need information from multiple systems but don’t know where to look” This 30-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge. 🤔 Why Start with ALM? New to Power Platform or Copilot Studio? You might be eager to start building agents right away, but taking a few minutes to set up Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) first will save you hours of headaches later! Think of ALM as preparing your kitchen before cooking a complex meal: Without ALM: Ingredients scattered across counters, no recipe plan, impromptu grocery trips mid-cooking With ALM: Ingredients organized, recipe prepared, everything measured and ready Common beginner challenges solved by ALM: “I built something great in dev, but can’t easily move it to production” “Someone changed my agent and now it’s broken - who did it and how do I fix it?” “I need to update my agent but I’m afraid of breaking what works” “My team members keep overwriting each other’s changes” The few minutes ALM setup in this lab prevents all these problems! 🌐 ALM Introduction Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) ensures that your solutions evolve safely and efficiently as they move from development to production. This lab will walk you through the foundational best practices of ALM in Microsoft Copilot Studio—from structuring your solution to managing configurations and source control. Real-world example: Imagine you’ve built a great customer service agent in your development environment. Without proper ALM: Moving to production means manually recreating all your work If something breaks, you can’t easily roll back to a working version When multiple team members make changes, work gets overwritten With the ALM practices in this lab, you’ll avoid these pitfalls and set yourself up for success! 🎓 Core ALM Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Solution A standard way in Microsoft Power Platform to package and ship components—including Microsoft Copilot Studio agent components like topics, knowledge sources, and tools—across environments alongside flows, prompts, environment variables, connection references, and any other solution-aware component types. Publisher A metadata element that identifies the creator of solution components. Using a custom publisher improves traceability and supports cleaner prefixes in naming conventions. Environment A workspace in Power Platform where no-code, low-code, or pro-code artifacts—such as agents, flows, and data—reside. ALM best practices typically involve multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) to manage lifecycle stages. For admins, environments also provide governance controls to limit what makers can do, which connectors or knowledge sources can be used, and how assets are secured and deployed. Connection reference An abstraction that links connectors (e.g., SharePoint, Dataverse, ServiceNow, etc.) to credentials and environment-specific settings—allowing reuse and cleaner ALM processes. 🌐 Lab Introduction In today’s fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it’s HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently. Real-world example: Imagine Sarah, a new employee, needs to understand her health benefits. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent Ask me anything agent, Sarah simply types What are the Northwind Health Plus Benefit plans? and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration. She can also check on her ServiceNow incidents instantly using the same agent. This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses. 🎓 Core Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Knowledge Source Integration Connects your agent to multiple data sources (SharePoint, ServiceNow, custom APIs) so employees get comprehensive answers from a single interface, eliminating the need to search multiple systems. Microsoft 365 Copilot Deployment Makes your agent available where employees already work, integrating seamlessly into their daily Microsoft 365 workflow for maximum adoption and convenience. Multi-agent orchestration Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent. 📄 Documentation and Additional Training Links Microsoft Copilot Studio Documentation Knowledge Sources in Copilot Studio Create child agents in Copilot Studio (preview) Deploy Copilot Studio agents to Microsoft 365 ServiceNow connector for Power Platform ✅ Prerequisites Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio with appropriate licensing.

Use case Value added Estimated effort Add ServiceNow Incidents Integrates real-time incident management for comprehensive support capabilities with agent scoping best practices 10 minutes Summary of tasks In this section, you’ll configure the connection to ServiceNow to retrieve incident details, and learn how to scope agent capabilities for specific domains. This demonstrates how specialized tools can be integrated to create domain-specific expertise within your agent. Scenario: Employees need quick access to their ServiceNow incident status without navigating to the ServiceNow portal. By integrating ServiceNow directly into your agent, you’re creating a specialized IT support capability that showcases agent scoping - where specific tools and knowledge are targeted for particular use cases, improving productivity and reducing support burden. Understanding Agent Scoping with ServiceNow Integration This use case demonstrates agent scoping principles: Specialized Tools: ServiceNow integration provides domain-specific capabilities Contextual Routing: IT-related queries automatically leverage ServiceNow tools Unified Experience: Users get comprehensive support from a single agent interface Step-by-step instructions Create a child agent Go to your Ask Me Anything agent Go to the Agents tab, and + Add an agent Update Its Name to: IT Support Agent Its Description to: Use this agent for queries related to IT (e.g., knowledge base frequently asked questions, incident updates, etc.) The agent can multiple multiple questions and queries at once. Its Instructions to: Use knowledge for problem/how-to/questions. Use the Get ServiceNow ticket details tool to get the status of incidents. Add knowledge to the child agent Select + Add in the Knowledge section of the child agent Select ServiceNow Choose the ServiceNow connection in Created by my admin Select Add Add ServiceNow ticket details as a Tool to the child agent Still within the IT Support Agent Scroll down to Tools and + Add a tool Search for ServiceNow List records Select Add to Agent, then Save your child agent, and scroll down to the Tools section and select the List records tool you just added. [!TIP] In case of issues, refresh the page with CTRL + F5. Click on the Kebab menu (⋮) next to the List Records Tool, click Edit. Change the Name to Get ServiceNow ticket details Change Description to: Gets the details of an incident using its incident number. Use this tool when users ask about ServiceNow tickets, incident status, or IT support requests. [!TIP] The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it’s important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage. Expand Additional details, change Credentials to use to Maker-provided credentials [!IMPORTANT] In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents. For Record Type, set a Custom value and choose Incident Select + Add input and choose Query Select Customize and change the Display name to Incident Query use this for Description: The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., &#39;numberCONTAINSINC0007001&#39;. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001) [!TIP] Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries. If you get a “There is an error: ‘DuplicateItem’” error, toggle to Custom value, then switch back to Dynamically fill with AI and set the customized description again. Select + Add input and choose Limit Select Custom Value and set 1 Select Save Test your IT Support Agent Test your agent: My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you&#39;re here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve opened them... thanks!! [!TIP] Notice how the agent automatically: Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060) Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed Observe how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities: Tool Selection: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent Context Preservation: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools Domain Expertise: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps Unified Experience: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources [!IMPORTANT] This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent. Publish your agent and test the third Suggested prompt regarding ticket status in M365 Copilot (and Teams if needed). Note: you don’t need to reload your agent or restart the conversation. Your Ask Me Anything agent is now capable to query Service Now and resolve support issues based on Service Now Knowledge bases as well as query Incident details for you. 🏅 Congratulations! You’ve completed Use Case #6 Test your understanding How does ServiceNow integration enhance the employee experience compared to traditional ticket lookup methods? What other enterprise systems could benefit from similar agent integration? 🏆 Summary of learnings True learning comes from doing, questioning, and reflecting—so let’s put your skills to the test. To maximize the impact of your “Ask me anything” agent: Knowledge Integration – Connect multiple data sources to provide comprehensive answers from a single conversational interface, eliminating information silos Seamless Deployment – Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet employees where they already work, maximizing adoption and convenience Multi-agent orchestration - Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent. Conclusions and recommendations Ask me anything agent golden rules: Start with high-value, frequently asked questions to demonstrate immediate ROI Implement proper authentication and permissions to ensure knowledge security Use suggested prompts to guide users toward the agent’s best capabilities Design context-aware experiences that reduce user input while increasing relevance Maintain human oversight for critical processes while automating routine tasks Monitor and analyze conversation patterns to identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities By following these principles, you’ll create an intelligent knowledge hub that transforms how employees access information, reduces support burden, and improves organizational efficiency through conversational AI." />

Use case Value added Estimated effort Add ServiceNow Incidents Integrates real-time incident management for comprehensive support capabilities with agent scoping best practices 10 minutes Summary of tasks In this section, you’ll configure the connection to ServiceNow to retrieve incident details, and learn how to scope agent capabilities for specific domains. This demonstrates how specialized tools can be integrated to create domain-specific expertise within your agent. Scenario: Employees need quick access to their ServiceNow incident status without navigating to the ServiceNow portal. By integrating ServiceNow directly into your agent, you’re creating a specialized IT support capability that showcases agent scoping - where specific tools and knowledge are targeted for particular use cases, improving productivity and reducing support burden. Understanding Agent Scoping with ServiceNow Integration This use case demonstrates agent scoping principles: Specialized Tools: ServiceNow integration provides domain-specific capabilities Contextual Routing: IT-related queries automatically leverage ServiceNow tools Unified Experience: Users get comprehensive support from a single agent interface Step-by-step instructions Create a child agent Go to your Ask Me Anything agent Go to the Agents tab, and + Add an agent Update Its Name to: IT Support Agent Its Description to: Use this agent for queries related to IT (e.g., knowledge base frequently asked questions, incident updates, etc.) The agent can multiple multiple questions and queries at once.

Change the Name to Get ServiceNow ticket details Change Description to: Gets the details of an incident using its incident number. Use this tool when users ask about ServiceNow tickets, incident status, or IT support requests. [!TIP] The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it’s important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage. Expand Additional details, change Credentials to use to Maker-provided credentials [!IMPORTANT] In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents. For Record Type, set a Custom value and choose Incident Select + Add input and choose Query Select Customize and change the Display name to Incident Query use this for Description: The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., &#39;numberCONTAINSINC0007001&#39;. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001) [!TIP] Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries. If you get a “There is an error: ‘DuplicateItem’” error, toggle to Custom value, then switch back to Dynamically fill with AI and set the customized description again. Select + Add input and choose Limit Select Custom Value and set 1 Select Save Test your IT Support Agent Test your agent: My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you&#39;re here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve opened them... thanks!! [!TIP] Notice how the agent automatically: Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060) Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed Observe how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities: Tool Selection: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent Context Preservation: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools Domain Expertise: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps Unified Experience: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources [!IMPORTANT] This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent. Publish your agent and test the third Suggested prompt regarding ticket status in M365 Copilot (and Teams if needed). Note: you don’t need to reload your agent or restart the conversation. Your Ask Me Anything agent is now capable to query Service Now and resolve support issues based on Service Now Knowledge bases as well as query Incident details for you. 🏅 Congratulations! You’ve completed Use Case #6 Test your understanding How does ServiceNow integration enhance the employee experience compared to traditional ticket lookup methods? What other enterprise systems could benefit from similar agent integration? 🏆 Summary of learnings True learning comes from doing, questioning, and reflecting—so let’s put your skills to the test. To maximize the impact of your “Ask me anything” agent: Knowledge Integration – Connect multiple data sources to provide comprehensive answers from a single conversational interface, eliminating information silos Seamless Deployment – Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet employees where they already work, maximizing adoption and convenience Multi-agent orchestration - Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent.

Participants will deploy agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot, use multi-agent orchestration to query a child agent to connect to ServiceNow to retrieve ticket status. 📚 Table of Contents Why This Matters Why Start with ALM? ALM Introduction Core ALM Concepts Overview Lab Introduction Core Concepts Overview Documentation and Additional Training Links Prerequisites Summary of Targets Use Cases Covered Instructions by Use Case Use Case #1: Create a solution and custom publisher Use Case #2: Create connection references Use Case #3: Create an ‘Ask Me Anything’ Agent with SharePoint Knowledge Use Case #4: Configure Suggested Prompts Use Case #5: Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot Use Case #6: Create a child IT Support Agent 🤔 Why This Matters Makers and IT professionals - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems? Think of your organization’s knowledge like a library: Without an intelligent agent: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available With an intelligent agent: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations Common challenges solved by this lab: “I can’t find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site” “What’s the status of my ServiceNow incident?” “I need information from multiple systems but don’t know where to look” This 30-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge. 🤔 Why Start with ALM? New to Power Platform or Copilot Studio? You might be eager to start building agents right away, but taking a few minutes to set up Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) first will save you hours of headaches later! Think of ALM as preparing your kitchen before cooking a complex meal: Without ALM: Ingredients scattered across counters, no recipe plan, impromptu grocery trips mid-cooking With ALM: Ingredients organized, recipe prepared, everything measured and ready Common beginner challenges solved by ALM: “I built something great in dev, but can’t easily move it to production” “Someone changed my agent and now it’s broken - who did it and how do I fix it?” “I need to update my agent but I’m afraid of breaking what works” “My team members keep overwriting each other’s changes” The few minutes ALM setup in this lab prevents all these problems! 🌐 ALM Introduction Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) ensures that your solutions evolve safely and efficiently as they move from development to production. This lab will walk you through the foundational best practices of ALM in Microsoft Copilot Studio—from structuring your solution to managing configurations and source control. Real-world example: Imagine you’ve built a great customer service agent in your development environment. Without proper ALM: Moving to production means manually recreating all your work If something breaks, you can’t easily roll back to a working version When multiple team members make changes, work gets overwritten With the ALM practices in this lab, you’ll avoid these pitfalls and set yourself up for success! 🎓 Core ALM Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Solution A standard way in Microsoft Power Platform to package and ship components—including Microsoft Copilot Studio agent components like topics, knowledge sources, and tools—across environments alongside flows, prompts, environment variables, connection references, and any other solution-aware component types. Publisher A metadata element that identifies the creator of solution components. Using a custom publisher improves traceability and supports cleaner prefixes in naming conventions. Environment A workspace in Power Platform where no-code, low-code, or pro-code artifacts—such as agents, flows, and data—reside. ALM best practices typically involve multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) to manage lifecycle stages. For admins, environments also provide governance controls to limit what makers can do, which connectors or knowledge sources can be used, and how assets are secured and deployed. Connection reference An abstraction that links connectors (e.g., SharePoint, Dataverse, ServiceNow, etc.) to credentials and environment-specific settings—allowing reuse and cleaner ALM processes. 🌐 Lab Introduction In today’s fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it’s HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently. Real-world example: Imagine Sarah, a new employee, needs to understand her health benefits. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent Ask me anything agent, Sarah simply types What are the Northwind Health Plus Benefit plans? and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration. She can also check on her ServiceNow incidents instantly using the same agent. This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses. 🎓 Core Concepts Overview Concept Why it matters Knowledge Source Integration Connects your agent to multiple data sources (SharePoint, ServiceNow, custom APIs) so employees get comprehensive answers from a single interface, eliminating the need to search multiple systems. Microsoft 365 Copilot Deployment Makes your agent available where employees already work, integrating seamlessly into their daily Microsoft 365 workflow for maximum adoption and convenience. Multi-agent orchestration Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent. 📄 Documentation and Additional Training Links Microsoft Copilot Studio Documentation Knowledge Sources in Copilot Studio Create child agents in Copilot Studio (preview) Deploy Copilot Studio agents to Microsoft 365 ServiceNow connector for Power Platform ✅ Prerequisites Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio with appropriate licensing.

Its Instructions to: Use knowledge for problem/how-to/questions. Use the Get ServiceNow ticket details tool to get the status of incidents. Add knowledge to the child agent Select + Add in the Knowledge section of the child agent Select ServiceNow Choose the ServiceNow connection in Created by my admin Select Add Add ServiceNow ticket details as a Tool to the child agent Still within the IT Support Agent Scroll down to Tools and + Add a tool Search for ServiceNow List records Select Add to Agent, then Save your child agent, and scroll down to the Tools section and select the List records tool you just added. [!TIP] In case of issues, refresh the page with CTRL + F5. Click on the Kebab menu (⋮) next to the List Records Tool, click Edit. Change the Name to Get ServiceNow ticket details Change Description to: Gets the details of an incident using its incident number. Use this tool when users ask about ServiceNow tickets, incident status, or IT support requests. [!TIP] The description will help the AI know when to use that tool, so it’s important to have clear instructions WHEN and WHEN NOT to use this tool. This is a key aspect of agent scoping - being specific about tool usage. Expand Additional details, change Credentials to use to Maker-provided credentials [!IMPORTANT] In production scenarios, you may want to use the user context when making the connection to ServiceNow. Here, your context (as the author) is used by end-users of your agent when searching for incidents. For Record Type, set a Custom value and choose Incident Select + Add input and choose Query Select Customize and change the Display name to Incident Query use this for Description: The output of this variable is the concatenation of numberCONTAINS and the incident number. E.g., &#39;numberCONTAINSINC0007001&#39;. Only the incident number should be prompted and obtained from the user (e.g., INC0007001) [!TIP] Again, these instructions will be used by AI to understand how determine how to pass that information to the ServiceNow connector. In this case, how to use the very specific OData formatting of ServiceNow queries. If you get a “There is an error: ‘DuplicateItem’” error, toggle to Custom value, then switch back to Dynamically fill with AI and set the customized description again. Select + Add input and choose Limit Select Custom Value and set 1 Select Save Test your IT Support Agent Test your agent: My USB port is no longer working on my PC... what can I do? While you&#39;re here, can you also share an update for case INC0000059? It&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve opened them... thanks!! [!TIP] Notice how the agent automatically: Uses the appropriate ServiceNow tool based on the query type Handles multiple tickets in a single request (e.g., if you ask for both cases INC0000059 and INC0000060) Creates user-friendly responses with proper formatting Combines ServiceNow data with other knowledge sources when needed Observe how your agent now demonstrates scoped capabilities: Tool Selection: Automatically chooses the right ServiceNow tool based on user intent Context Preservation: Maintains conversation flow while using specialized tools Domain Expertise: Provides IT-specific guidance and next steps Unified Experience: Seamlessly integrates ServiceNow capabilities with other knowledge sources [!IMPORTANT] This integration showcases how agents can be scoped for specific domains while maintaining a unified user experience. The ServiceNow knowledge and tools are automatically triggered for IT-related queries, demonstrating intelligent capability routing within a single agent. Publish your agent and test the third Suggested prompt regarding ticket status in M365 Copilot (and Teams if needed). Note: you don’t need to reload your agent or restart the conversation. Your Ask Me Anything agent is now capable to query Service Now and resolve support issues based on Service Now Knowledge bases as well as query Incident details for you. 🏅 Congratulations! You’ve completed Use Case #6 Test your understanding How does ServiceNow integration enhance the employee experience compared to traditional ticket lookup methods? What other enterprise systems could benefit from similar agent integration? 🏆 Summary of learnings True learning comes from doing, questioning, and reflecting—so let’s put your skills to the test. To maximize the impact of your “Ask me anything” agent: Knowledge Integration – Connect multiple data sources to provide comprehensive answers from a single conversational interface, eliminating information silos Seamless Deployment – Deploy to Microsoft 365 Copilot to meet employees where they already work, maximizing adoption and convenience Multi-agent orchestration - Rather than relying on a single agent to do everything, build a multi-agent system where the main agent delegates tasks to a child agent. Conclusions and recommendations Ask me anything agent golden rules: Start with high-value, frequently asked questions to demonstrate immediate ROI Implement proper authentication and permissions to ensure knowledge security Use suggested prompts to guide users toward the agent’s best capabilities Design context-aware experiences that reduce user input while increasing relevance Maintain human oversight for critical processes while automating routine tasks Monitor and analyze conversation patterns to identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities By following these principles, you’ll create an intelligent knowledge hub that transforms how employees access information, reduces support burden, and improves organizational efficiency through conversational AI.","headline":"Ask Me Anything Agent (30 min version)","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://0.0.0.0:4000/mcs-labs/labs/ask-me-anything-30-mins/"},"url":"http://0.0.0.0:4000/mcs-labs/labs/ask-me-anything-30-mins/"}</script>

<h2 id="-why-this-matters">🤔 Why This Matters</h2>

<p><strong>Makers and IT professionals</strong> - Tired of employees constantly asking the same questions about policies, benefits, or system status? Frustrated by scattered knowledge across multiple systems?</p>

<p>Think of your organization’s knowledge like a library:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Without an intelligent agent</strong>: Employees waste hours searching through SharePoint folders, submitting IT tickets for simple questions, and interrupting colleagues for information that should be readily available</li>
  <li><strong>With an intelligent agent</strong>: Employees get instant, accurate answers from a single conversational interface that automatically searches across all your knowledge sources with proper citations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common challenges solved by this lab:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“I can’t find the leave policy for my country in our SharePoint site”</li>
  <li>“What’s the status of my ServiceNow incident?”</li>
  <li>“I need information from multiple systems but don’t know where to look”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This 30-minute investment will save your organization countless hours and improve employee satisfaction by providing instant access to knowledge.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-why-start-with-alm">🤔 Why Start with ALM?</h2>

<p><strong>New to Power Platform or Copilot Studio?</strong> You might be eager to start building agents right away, but taking a few minutes to set up Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) first will save you hours of headaches later!</p>

<p>Think of ALM as preparing your kitchen before cooking a complex meal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Without ALM</strong>: Ingredients scattered across counters, no recipe plan, impromptu grocery trips mid-cooking</li>
  <li><strong>With ALM</strong>: Ingredients organized, recipe prepared, everything measured and ready</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common beginner challenges solved by ALM:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“I built something great in dev, but can’t easily move it to production”</li>
  <li>“Someone changed my agent and now it’s broken - who did it and how do I fix it?”</li>
  <li>“I need to update my agent but I’m afraid of breaking what works”</li>
  <li>“My team members keep overwriting each other’s changes”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The few minutes ALM setup in this lab prevents all these problems!</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-alm-introduction">🌐 ALM Introduction</h2>

<p>Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) ensures that your solutions evolve safely and efficiently as they move from development to production. This lab will walk you through the foundational best practices of ALM in Microsoft Copilot Studio—from structuring your solution to managing configurations and source control.</p>

<p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Imagine you’ve built a great customer service agent in your development environment. Without proper ALM:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Moving to production means manually recreating all your work</li>
  <li>If something breaks, you can’t easily roll back to a working version</li>
  <li>When multiple team members make changes, work gets overwritten</li>
</ol>

<p>With the ALM practices in this lab, you’ll avoid these pitfalls and set yourself up for success!</p>

<h2 id="-lab-introduction">🌐 Lab Introduction</h2>

<p>In today’s fast-paced business environment, employees need quick access to accurate information from multiple sources. Whether it’s HR policies, IT incident status, or custom knowledge bases, information is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Imagine Sarah, a new employee, needs to understand her health benefits. Currently, she might spend 30 minutes navigating through SharePoint folders, trying different search terms, or even asking HR colleagues. With an intelligent <em>Ask me anything</em> agent, Sarah simply types <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What are the Northwind Health Plus Benefit plans?</code> and instantly receives the accurate policy document with proper citations, saving time and reducing frustration. She can also check on her ServiceNow incidents instantly using the same agent.</p>

<p>This lab teaches you to build a comprehensive solution that transforms how employees interact with organizational knowledge, creating a single conversational interface that intelligently routes questions to the right knowledge sources and provides contextual, accurate responses.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!TIP]</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you requested for a new user account using the <strong>Training Assistant</strong> agent, we auto provisioned a new Developer Environment with <strong>‘DEV - &lt;your current User Name&gt;‘</strong> as the name of the environment.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="create-a-solution">Create a solution</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the left navigation (under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code> menu), select <strong>Solutions</strong></p>

    <p><img src="images/solutions.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!TIP]</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Avoid names like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEV</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TEST</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POC</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MVP</code> or anything tied to a project lifecycle phase, as the same solution will move to different environments as part of the ALM process.</li>
    <li>Use a descriptive, project-based name.</li>
    <li>For example, if this is specific to this training and lab, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Training Workshop Agents</code></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="create-a-publisher">Create a publisher</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If this is your first solution, click <strong>+ New publisher</strong> to create one. You can use <strong>MCS Lab</strong> as the Display Name, <strong>MCSLab</strong> as the Name, and <strong>mcslab</strong> as the Prefix and <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
