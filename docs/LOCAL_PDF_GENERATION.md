# PDF Generation

This guide explains how PDFs are generated for lab download functionality.

## GitHub Actions (Primary Method)

PDFs are automatically generated by GitHub Actions when you push changes to the repository.

### How It Works
1. GitHub Actions workflow detects changes to lab files
2. Runs `.github/scripts/generate-pdf.js` for each lab
3. Generates PDFs using Puppeteer and Node.js
4. Outputs PDFs to `assets/pdfs/{lab-name}.pdf`

### Process
1. Markdown preprocessing (callouts, header cleanup)
2. HTML conversion with styling
3. PDF generation with navigation

## Local Development

For local development, you don't need to generate PDFs. The PDF download buttons will work once changes are pushed to GitHub and the workflow completes.

### Viewing Existing PDFs Locally
Existing PDFs are already in `assets/pdfs/` and will work with the Jekyll development server:

```bash
# Start Jekyll development server
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# OR with Docker:
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:4000/mcs-labs/labs/ - PDF download buttons for existing labs will work.

### New Labs
New labs added locally won't have PDFs until:
1. Changes are pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions workflow completes
3. PDFs are generated and committed to the repository

## Testing PDF Downloads

After PDFs are generated (by GitHub Actions):

1. Start Jekyll development server (see above)
2. Visit http://localhost:4000/mcs-labs/labs/
3. PDF download buttons will work in:
   - Lab cards (ðŸ“„ PDF button)
   - Individual lab pages (Download PDF Version section)

## Lab Folders with Existing PDFs

Some labs have pre-generated PDFs in their `local-dist/` folders from previous workflows. These are not used by Jekyll - only PDFs in `assets/pdfs/` are served.
