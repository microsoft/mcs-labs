- **Bootcamp System**: Special curated sequence with custom ordering (1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 3b, etc.) for intensive learning
- **Smart Previous/Next**: Context-aware navigation that respects your current journey or bootcamp progress
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile learning experiences
- **Mobile TOC**: Floating table of contents button on screens ≤ 1366px for easy navigation
- **Multi-Level Navigation**: Hierarchical TOC supporting both main sections (h2) and subsections (h3)

Access the bootcamp through the top navigation or visit [Labs Portal - Bootcamp](https://microsoft.github.io/mcs-labs/labs/bootcamp/).

- **Search & Filter**: Quick access to specific labs by journey, bootcamp, or topic

### Automated HTML and PDF Generation

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically convert lab markdown files into professional HTML and PDF formats using **Pandoc 3.1.3**:

- **HTML versions**: Web-ready with styling and navigation
- **PDF versions**: Print-ready with embedded images, Mermaid diagrams, and syntax highlighting
- **Local generation**: PDFs can also be generated locally using Docker (see [LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md](./docs/LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md))
- **Generated files**: Available in the `dist/` directory and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pratapladhani.github.io/mcs-labs/)

**Key PDF Features:**
- ✅ GitHub-style callouts ([!NOTE], [!WARNING], etc.) rendered with proper styling
- ✅ Mermaid diagrams rendered to static SVG
- ✅ Embedded images (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- ✅ Professional layout with page numbers and headers

**🎯 Local/CI Parity (CRITICAL)**:
- Local PDF generation MUST match GitHub Actions exactly to prevent deployment failures
- **Always test locally before pushing** if you modify lab content, diagrams, or PDF generation
- See [LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md](./docs/LOCAL_PDF_GENERATION.md) for complete testing guide

```powershell
# Test PDF generation locally before pushing
.\scripts\Generate-Labs.ps1 -GeneratePDFs

# Quick test for a single lab
.\scripts\Generate-Labs.ps1 -SingleLabPDF "your-lab-name" -GeneratePDFs
```

### 🌐 Local Testing

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Start the development server
docker-compose up -d jekyll-dev

### 🚀 Quick Start (For Developers)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: After cloning, you must generate content files first:

```powershell
# REQUIRED: Generate Jekyll content from lab sources
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/Generate-Labs.ps1 -SkipPDFs

# Then start development server
docker-compose up -d

# Access the site at:
# http://localhost:4000/mcs-labs/
```

**Note**: The `index.md` files are auto-generated and not stored in git. Always run the generation script after cloning!

**Note**: The `/mcs-labs/` path is required for local testing due to Jekyll's baseurl configuration.
