# =====================================================
# AUTO-DISCOVERY RULES (Optional - for documentation)
# =====================================================
# The system automatically:
# 1. Scans labs/ folders for README.md files
# 2. Extracts metadata from lab details tables
# 3. Auto-assigns sections based on:
#    - Difficulty levels (100=core, 200=intermediate, 300+=advanced)
#    - Folder name patterns (autonomous=advanced, 30-mins=optional, etc.)
# 4. Auto-assigns journeys based on:
#    - Difficulty and content analysis
#    - Keywords in titles and descriptions
# 5. Uses intelligent defaults for missing metadata

# To override auto-assignment, add YAML front matter to lab README files:
# ---
# journeys: ["custom-journey"]
# section: "custom_section"
# difficulty: 150
# duration: 45
# ---
